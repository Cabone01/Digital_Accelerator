## Introduction
PwC Switzerland is making a strategic decision to invest in upskilling programs so their people can learn to use data visualization as well as automation and data cleansing. Investing to become more intuitive in PowerBI and machine learning. This Digital Accelerator program is what I will be joining to advance my experience in PowerBI as well as automation, design thinking, and storytelling.

## Call Centre Trends
I was contacted by a PhoneNow client who is looking for an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behavior. So then a dashboard was created to reflect relevant KPIs in the dataset.    
    
1. To begin with, we can see that the average satisfaction rating of PhoneNow agents is 3.4/5. An issue that I have found that could be lowering this is that only 1/10 of the calls are resolved.

2. Now let's look at the scores of each agent to see how they are doing. Below we can see the average satisfactory score of each agent. Both Martha and Dan are performing marginally better with Martha has the highest average at 3.47 followed by Dan at 3.45. Then at the lowest, we have Joe at 3.33. It would be important to focus on Joe, Becky, and Jim as they are below the 3.4 average.

3. So before looking at the below graph, let me explain it first. First, the numbers above each bar that are visible, are the average satisfactory rating for the bar by agent. The bar itself shows the amount of calls related to that topic an agent had. Here we can see that each agent has strengths and weaknesses. Joe who appears to be the lowest rated agent, performed very well with admin and contract related topics with a rating of 3.49 and 3.42. To improve them even further, it would help to train them for payment and streaming topics as those are at 3.2. Despite having the second lowest average rating, Becky does very well in comparison to payment-related calls which is her second highest amount of topics. Another note to make is that it would be best to improve training in contract and payment topics as those both are consistently lower throughout the agents.

## Customer Retention
A retention manager from the telecom reached out to me and asked to put together a dashboard about customer retention. Here are my findings.    
    
1. Below we can see that 26.54% of customers have churned. This is unideal.

2. One point to focus on would be the Internet service. Customers that have fiber optic are drastically more likely to churn. Approximately 42% of them have churned out of nearly 3100. Compare this with DSL which has 19% of customers churned. Improving this service by either having it checked or updating it should help to see the retention of more customers.

3. The next reason will be grouped because they are linked. Customers who refuse device protection, tech support, online security, and backup are likelier to churn. Each of these categories has above 40% churning with customers. However, it can be seen that those who accepted the service only have a churn rate of about 20%. It will be important to push these services and support the customers as it improves customer retention. A package deal with several of these could assist with that.

4. Of all the payment methods offered, it would appear that paperless electronic checks have the most churned customers at 867 out of 1754 in that category. This is far higher than every other method. This paperless payment method also has the customers that make the most tech tickets and admin tickets at 954 and 411. There might be an error arising with this payment method and paperless billing so having it fixed will prevent more customers from churning.

6. Lastly, it would appear that customers who do not have partners or dependents are more likely to churn than those who do. About a third of partnerless or dependentless customers churn while less than a fifth of those that do have churn. It could help to have a discount or package deals for customers like this to improve retention.

## Diversity, Inclusion, and Turnover
HR at the telecom client is highly into diversity, inclusion, and turnover. They are seeing little progress and are reaching out to us. Here are my findings.    

1. So here we can see that there is an uneven divide between women and men in there. This does not however reflect with hiring as I found that in 2020 34 women and 32 men were hired. But this is an example of slow progress because even though they are equal in hires, the difference in total is 90 which is quite a large difference. So gradually hiring more women compared to men will help to even this part out.

2. To further discuss the previous topic, I developed a few numbers to talk about. I found that 8.78% of women and 11.19% of men are promoted. I also found that 12.28% of women and 9.89% of men turnover. Though the difference is small, this could be resulting in slower progress with inclusion.
3. So before looking at the graph below, this is the job level of women and men before and after promotions were done in the years 2020 and 2021. The data for the promotions before 2021 is included with promotions after 2020. The promotions also go from 6 down to 1 being the highest role. So we can see that a large number of women got promoted in 2020 to Senior officers. This however is the only noticeable improvement for women. The following job levels appear to stay the same or only very slightly change. The men then appear to get promoted into higher positions more consistently as Manager, Senior Manager, and Director levels jump up in number. There is a discrepancy between men and women in the higher job levels compared to the low which could be causing the slightly higher rate of turnover.

4. From here, we will be looking more into turnover. I found that out of all the age groups, 40-49 had the highest turnover and 50-59 had the highest percentage at 66.67%. Interestingly I found that over 90% of the turnover in those age groups was the lowest two roles of Senior Officers and Junior Officers.          
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5c01217-3a36-46cf-9ee0-dcbefbd166a9)    
5. So below we are looking at if the turnover is affected by the amount of years they have been there. I could say without doubt there is not much of a correlation between the two. It would appear that this does not affect it. However, I dove further into this by looking into the jobs in the graph below this.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/406d9e19-5547-44e7-a012-082b85b9f435)    
6. Here I found that many of the workers that turnover do so, around 3 years into working a certain job level. This tracks with the average I found being 2.9 years for Junior Officers, 3.8 years for Senior Officers, 3.5 years for Managers, 3.4 years for Senior Managers, 3.3 for Executives, and 2.0 years for Directors. I found that it is also the men that stay 5 or more years in a job role. Now I do not recommend promotion without reason instead, it might be important to offer long-term benefits outside of the job position to prevent turnover.
